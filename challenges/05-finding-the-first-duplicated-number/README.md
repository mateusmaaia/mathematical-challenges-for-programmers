# 05 - Finding the first duplicated number

## Challenge

You need to find the first number inside the array that is duplicated. Simple like that. 

#### Constraints

- The array only have integers
- The values of that array only can be >= 1 and <= array length

You also need to do it the more performatic way, avoid answers bigger or equal O(N)

## Example

Input: 
`
[1,12,10,19,20,14,13,8,7,16,18,6,2,3,15,18,9,4,5,11,17,10,13]
`

Output:
`
18
`
